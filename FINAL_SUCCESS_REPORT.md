## 🚀 **ISSUE RESOLVED: JSX Syntax Error Fixed**

### **✅ Problem Identified and Fixed**
- **Issue**: JSX syntax error in `Admin.jsx` - React Fragment not properly closed
- **Error**: `Expected corresponding JSX closing tag for <>.`
- **Location**: Line 338 in `neetlogiq-frontend/src/pages/Admin.jsx`
- **Solution**: Restructured JSX to properly close the React Fragment and moved Quick Actions inside dashboard conditional

### **✅ Fix Applied**
```jsx
// Before (Broken)
{activeTab === 'dashboard' && (
  <>
    <div className="space-y-8">
      <BMADStatus />
      // ... other elements
    </div>
    // Quick Actions outside fragment - causing error
  </>
)}

// After (Fixed)
{activeTab === 'dashboard' && (
  <div className="space-y-8">
    <BMADStatus />
    // ... other elements
    
    {/* Quick Actions */}
    <motion.div>
      // ... quick actions
    </motion.div>
  </div>
)}
```
