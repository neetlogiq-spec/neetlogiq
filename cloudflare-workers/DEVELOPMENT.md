# Development Notes

## Issues and Solutions

### Worker Not Responding to Requests

**Issue:** The worker was not responding to requests when running locally.

**Investigation:**
- Checked for build errors - none found
- Verified that the worker was starting correctly
- Identified that the worker was failing due to missing AI and Vectorize bindings

**Solution:**
1. Modified the code to handle missing dependencies gracefully
2. Added checks for AI and Vectorize availability before using them
3. Updated TypesenseIntegration to check for availability before making requests
4. Updated BMADIntegration to check for AI availability before using AI features
5. Created a minimal worker for testing basic functionality

### Typesense Integration Issues

**Issue:** Typesense integration was failing when Typesense service was not available.

**Solution:**
- Added availability check in TypesenseIntegration constructor
- Added checks before making requests to Typesense
- Added fallback behavior when Typesense is not available

### BMAD AI Integration Issues

**Issue:** BMAD AI integration was failing when AI service was not available.

**Solution:**
- Added AI availability check in BMADIntegration constructor
- Added checks before using AI features
- Added fallback behavior when AI is not available

## Development Workflow

1. Use the minimal worker for basic testing:
   ```bash
   npx wrangler dev --config minimal-wrangler.toml
   ```

2. Use the full worker with experimental Vectorize binding for complete testing:
   ```bash
   npx wrangler dev --experimental-vectorize-bind-to-prod
   ```

3. Deploy to development environment:
   ```bash
   npm run deploy:dev
   ```

4. Deploy to production environment:
   ```bash
   npm run deploy:prod
   ```

## Code Structure

- `src/index.js`: Main worker code
- `src/bmad-integration.js`: BMAD AI integration
- `src/typesense-integration.js`: Typesense integration
- `src/test-worker.js`: Simplified test worker
- `src/minimal-worker.js`: Minimal worker for basic testing

## Future Improvements

1. Add more comprehensive error handling
2. Add more unit tests
3. Improve documentation
4. Add more logging
5. Add more monitoring
6. Add more security features

## Production Considerations

Before deploying to production, make sure to:

1. Remove any debug code
2. Update environment variables
3. Set proper CORS headers
4. Set proper security headers
5. Set proper caching headers
6. Set proper rate limiting
7. Set proper authentication
8. Set proper authorization
9. Set proper logging
10. Set proper monitoring
