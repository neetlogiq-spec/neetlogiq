## Current Admin Panel Files
- `src/pages/Admin.jsx` - Main admin panel component
- `src/components/SecurityTestPanel.jsx` - Security testing tools
- `ADMIN_SECURITY_PANEL.md` - Security panel documentation

## Re-enabling Admin Panel
To re-enable the admin panel:
1. Uncomment the Admin import in `App.jsx`
2. Uncomment the admin route in `App.jsx`
3. Implement proper authentication
4. Add security measures
5. Test thoroughly before going live

## Security Considerations
- Never expose admin panel without proper authentication
- Always implement proper access controls
- Log all admin activities
- Regular security audits
- Keep admin panel separate from public routes
