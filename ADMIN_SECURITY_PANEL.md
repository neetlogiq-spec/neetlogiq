# Admin Security Panel

## Overview
The Security Test Panel has been moved from the client-side (public) to the admin panel for security reasons. This ensures that security testing tools are only accessible to administrators and not visible to regular users.

## Access
- **URL**: `http://localhost:3000/neetlogiq-admin`
- **Route**: `/neetlogiq-admin`
- **Authentication**: Currently no authentication required (consider adding admin authentication)

## Features
The Security Test Panel is now available in the admin panel under the "Security" tab and includes:

### 1. Input Validation Testing
- Test various input types (normal, SQL injection, XSS, etc.)
- Validate input sanitization
- Check length limits and special character handling

### 2. Security Pattern Detection
- SQL Injection patterns
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attempts
- Command injection patterns
- Malicious script detection

### 3. Rate Limiting Testing
- Test rate limiting functionality
- Validate request throttling
- Check for abuse prevention

### 4. Security Headers Testing
- Test Content Security Policy (CSP)
- Validate security headers
- Check CORS configuration

## Security Benefits
1. **Hidden from Public**: Security testing tools are not visible to regular users
2. **Admin Only Access**: Only administrators can access security testing features
3. **Controlled Environment**: Testing is done in a controlled admin environment
4. **No Client Exposure**: Prevents potential security information disclosure

## Usage
1. Navigate to the admin panel
2. Click on the "Security" tab
3. Use the Security Test Panel to test various security features
4. Monitor results and validate security implementations

## Future Enhancements
- Add admin authentication to the admin panel
- Implement role-based access control
- Add security audit logging
- Create security reports and analytics
